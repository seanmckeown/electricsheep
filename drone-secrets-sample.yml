# This is a sample file for the secrets needed to successfully build and deploy this service
# with a drone.io server based on the included .drone.yml file
# Use this file as a template and save it as drone-secrets.yml, but do NOT commit to a repo
# You can then use the drone command line tools to create an encrypted version
# that can be committed to your repo for the Drone server to find and use.

# To encrypt:
#    drone secure --repo < GitHubAccount/REPONAME > --in drone-secrets.yml
